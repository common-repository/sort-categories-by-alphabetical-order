Displays posts in an alphabetical order from a category page.


== Description ==

Our company needed to display posts by alphabetical order (title). 
Since we did not find any plugin to do it, we've made one!
If we see people using it, we might add more options down the road. 


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Create a PAGE with the following content: [display-posts orderby="title" display-posts order="ASC" display-posts posts_per_page="50"]


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any settings in this plugin ? =
No, just activate it, and all your posts will be displayed by alphabetical order, based on their title. 

= What if I want to tweak the plugin ? =
Contact us, and send us your ideas. We're super open minded, and thrilled that people are using it !
We'll do our best to add your feature requests.
